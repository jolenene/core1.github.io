        <p>The prompt for this website is to make a simple, interactive game 
          using only html elements, such as buttons, colorpickers, etc. 
          I chose to embed lots of audioclips of people playing canon, 
        the cello quintet, and let users choose what speedthe song should be played,
        as well as how many players. I have fond memories of playing this piece with
        other people and always messing up:people always either missed the cue to start playing,
        or lost their tempo and ended faster or slower.<br>
          I wanted to replicate that feeling. Even though this idea is super simple, I really enjoy 
          playing around with it, the simplicity allows for further expansion as well. Maybe one day I'll
          make a whole band! For now, these ten players would be enough. Unrelated but it was so hard to 
          find singular people playing the song...most were people filming themselves practicing, which adds to
          the overall mood I believe. I learned to use audio elements in the project.

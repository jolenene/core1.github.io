    <p>The prompt for this particular assignment is to create a unique, interactive, 
      browser-based toy. I chose to make a parody of a computer virus, with the 
      random generator javascript code I was already familiar with.
      I initially wanted to make a game where the player has to move their
      cursor around in order to avoid the pop-ups, but that proved to be a 
      long-term project. I instead settled on a simple click-to-disappear game, 
      where users can click on the pop-up ads to make them disappear.<br>
      All artwork in this game is done by me with the help of Asperite, an 8-bit drawing 
      and animating tool. I based many of the designs off of stereotypical scam ads, 
      but also added a few more original ones that are slightly more positive. Overall,
      I'd say this is a great deal less stressful than an actual computer virus. I got to
      practice a lot of javascript while making this game, specifically "windows.getEventListener" 
      and the "sleep" function.
  </br></p>
  <p> <br>I ran into a lot of issues. </br>
    Namely, randomly generating images without the continuous clicking as well as faulty buttons. <br>
</br><br><img src="media/codepic.png"height=300px; width=500px;/></br>
<br> In the end, a new event listener was added <img src="media/click,funtion.png"height=10px; width=200px; margin-left=400px;/> which solves the issue</br></p>
